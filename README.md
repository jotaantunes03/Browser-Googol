# Browser-Googol
This repository contains the implementation of Googol, a distributed web search engine developed as part of the Distributed Systems course project for 2024/25. Inspired by leading search engines, it provides automatic indexing and search capabilities. The system uses a client-server architecture to ensure high availability through redundancy.
